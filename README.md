Overview

The Beekeeper's Weather Advisory App is a valuable tool for beekeepers who need to plan hive inspections based on weather conditions. Bees can become aggressive during cold, wet, or cloudy weather because they prioritize keeping warm and conserving honey to regulate hive temperature. This app provides real-time weather information to assist beekeepers in making informed decisions.
## Features

    Real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
    Dynamic background changes when the temperature falls below 15¬∞C.
    Customizable location settings for personalized weather updates.

## Tech Stack

    TypeScript: Utilizing the power of static typing for robust development. TypeScript
    React.js: Building a responsive and interactive user interface. React

## Getting Started

To use the app, follow these simple steps:

    Clone the project repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/beekeepers-weather-app.git

Navigate to the project directory:

### bash

    cd beekeepers-weather-app


Install the required packages:

## React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
